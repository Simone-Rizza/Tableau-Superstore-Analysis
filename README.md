# Tableau Superstore Analysis
 
The project involves the creation of a DASHBOARD and a STORY using Tableau to analyze the sales performance of a supermarket chain. 

The [DASHBOARD](https://public.tableau.com/shared/2T3CTNH28?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) is fully interactive and allows you to monitor:
- Sales trends over time
- The profit of the different countries in which it operates in Europe
- The amount of products shipped by shipping class

The [STORY](https://public.tableau.com/views/Book1_17247834519550/GestioneBudgetMarketing?:language=it-IT&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) also fully interactive allows you to understand:
- On which product it is better to allocate more budget
- On which product it is better to allocate less
- Which product do you recommend removing from the catalog
